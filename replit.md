- Security: Input validation, rate limiting, Firebase security rules

## Recent Changes (Latest Code Review & Security Fixes)

**Date: August 19, 2025**

### üìä Total Lending Calculation Fix (DEPLOYED)
- **Issue Fixed**: Updated "Total Lending" calculations to only include accepted offers
- **Dashboard**: Modified calculation logic to filter by `status === 'accepted'`  
- **Analytics**: Implemented same filtering logic with corrected imports
- **Logic Updated**: 
  - Sent 'lend' offers: Only count when accepted
  - Received 'borrow' offers: Only count when accepted (user is the lender)
- **Production**: Successfully deployed to https://crednxt-ef673.web.app
- **Impact**: Total Lending now accurately reflects only active lending amounts

### üîß Offers Display Fix (DEPLOYED)
- **Issue Fixed**: Resolved offers not being fetched/displayed in Dashboard and Offers pages
- **Standardized Fetching**: Both pages now use consistent firebaseBackend.getOffers() method
- **Simplified Logic**: Removed complex fallback queries causing inconsistencies
- **TypeScript Fixes**: Resolved import errors and type issues in offers components
- **Consistent Data**: Dashboard and Offers page now display same accurate offer data
- **Production**: Successfully deployed to https://crednxt-ef673.web.app
- **Impact**: Users can now properly view all their offers across both pages

### üöÄ Production Deployment (COMPLETED)
- **Firebase Hosting**: Successfully deployed to https://crednxt-ef673.web.app
- **Firebase Functions**: Backend API deployed to https://api-mzz6re522q-uc.a.run.app
- **Production Ready**: All security fixes and improvements are live
- **Public Access**: Platform is now accessible worldwide via secure HTTPS
- **Automated Deployment**: Uses FIREBASE_CONFIG_JSON secret for seamless deployment
- **Quick Deploy**: Simple `./deploy.sh` command for future deployments
