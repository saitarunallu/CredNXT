## System Architecture
The platform follows a mobile-first, security-first, and cloud-ready architectural approach.

- **System Design Choices**:
    - **Security First**: Emphasizes banking-grade authentication, audit trails, and security hardening.
    - **Compliance**: Designed to adhere to RBI guidelines and banking standards.
    - **Cloud Ready**: Built for cloud-native deployment.
    - **Firebase First**: Utilizes Firebase services for authentication, Firestore database, hosting, and functions.
    - **Monitoring**: Integrates comprehensive health checks (`/api/health`, `/api/ready`, `/api/live`, `/api/health/detailed`) for application monitoring.
    - **Database Schema**: Includes core entities like Users, Offers, Payments, Notifications, and Audit for robust functionality and compliance, primarily managed within Firestore.
