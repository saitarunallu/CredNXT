## Recent Changes (Real-Time Data Synchronization & Race Condition Fixes)

**Date: August 19, 2025**

### üîÑ Real-Time Offer Status Updates Fix (COMPLETED)
- **Issue Resolved**: Fixed offer details and status not updating without manual refresh across all pages
- **Root Cause**: Real-time listeners were only initialized in AuthGuard component, bypassing production routes
- **Technical Solution**: 
  - Enhanced real-time listeners to update all cache keys (`['offers', 'firebase']`, `['offer-details', offerId]`, `['dashboard-offers']`)
  - Added real-time hook initialization to all relevant pages (dashboard, offers list, offer detail)
  - Implemented aggressive cache invalidation with both setQueryData and invalidateQueries
  - Added comprehensive debugging and status change monitoring
- **Cache Synchronization**: Offer mutations now update all page caches simultaneously with forced re-renders
- **Production Deployed**: Real-time updates now work instantly across all pages without manual refresh needed

### üöÄ Cost-Efficient Real-Time Data Synchronization (COMPLETED)
- **Pure Firestore Architecture**: Replaced expensive polling with cost-efficient Firestore onSnapshot listeners
- **Zero Polling Cost**: Eliminated all automatic refresh intervals and API polling to minimize Firebase read charges
- **Real-Time Performance**: Instant updates through Firestore listeners without any cache invalidation overhead
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Added server-side status validation to prevent cancelled offers from being accepted
- **Direct Cache Management**: Mutations update cache directly instead of triggering expensive re-fetches
- **Firebase Hosting**: Successfully deployed to https://crednxt-ef673.web.app
- **Firebase Functions**: Backend API deployed to https://api-mzz6re522q-uc.a.run.app
- **Production Ready**: All cost-efficient real-time improvements and security fixes are live

### üîÑ Real-Time Data Improvements (Cost-Efficient)
- **Pure Firestore Listeners**: Replaced API polling with direct Firestore onSnapshot listeners for real-time updates
- **Cost Optimization**: Disabled automatic cache refresh intervals and invalidation to reduce Firebase read costs
- **Direct Cache Updates**: Mutations update React Query cache directly instead of triggering API calls
- **Query Limits**: Added intelligent limits (50 offers, 20 notifications) to reduce read costs
- **Server-Side Validation**: Prevents race conditions where cancelled offers could be accepted by checking current status
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: User-friendly error messages for specific race condition scenarios
- **Production Efficiency**: No WebSocket polling or aggressive refresh - pure Firestore real-time listeners only

### üîí Security Improvements  
- **Enhanced Error Boundary**: Consolidated duplicate error boundary components with improved error logging and recovery

- **Secret Management**: Removed all hardcoded credentials from codebase for safe remixing
- **Environment Security**: Implemented secure configuration management via Replit Secrets only

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes
- **Real-Time Race Conditions**: Fixed critical issue where recipients could accept cancelled offers due to stale data
- **Production WebSocket Limitation**: Resolved WebSocket unavailability in Firebase Functions with Firestore listener fallback

- **Unhandled Promise Rejections**: Added comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- **Firebase Auth**: Fixed token refresh logic and corrupted data cleanup
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript consistency and added proper type guards
- **Query Client**: Enhanced error handling for network failures and authentication issues
- **Phone Number Validation**: Fixed production error where undefined phone values caused `.replace()` to fail
- **Null Safety**: Enhanced all phone number formatting functions with proper type guards and null checks

### üìù Code Quality Improvements
- **Sanitization Utils**: Added comprehensive input sanitization functions
- **Error Logging**: Enhanced error tracking with context information
