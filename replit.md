## Recent Changes (Real-Time Data Synchronization & Race Condition Fixes)

**Date: August 19, 2025**

### üöÄ Real-Time Data Synchronization (COMPLETED)
- **Multi-Layer Approach**: Implemented comprehensive real-time updates using WebSocket + Firestore listeners + optimized React Query
- **Production-Ready**: Fixed WebSocket limitations in Firebase Functions by adding Firestore real-time listeners as fallback
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Added server-side status validation to prevent cancelled offers from being accepted
- **Aggressive Cache Management**: Reduced cache intervals from 30s to 5s for near real-time feel in production
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Specific user-friendly error messages for race conditions and status conflicts
- **Firebase Hosting**: Successfully deployed to https://crednxt-ef673.web.app
- **Firebase Functions**: Backend API deployed to https://api-mzz6re522q-uc.a.run.app
- **Production Ready**: All real-time improvements and security fixes are live

### üîÑ Real-Time Data Improvements
- **Firestore Real-Time Listeners**: Added comprehensive Firestore listeners for sent offers, received offers, and notifications
- **Dual Update System**: WebSocket for development + Firestore listeners for production ensures consistent real-time updates
- **Server-Side Validation**: Prevents race conditions where cancelled offers could be accepted by checking current status
- **Optimized Query Client**: Reduced stale time to 0 and refresh interval to 5 seconds for aggressive real-time updates
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: User-friendly error messages for specific race condition scenarios
- **Automatic Cache Refresh**: Failed operations trigger immediate cache invalidation to show current state

### üîí Security Improvements  
- **Enhanced Error Boundary**: Consolidated duplicate error boundary components with improved error logging and recovery
- **Firebase API Key Validation**: Fixed validation bug that was causing configuration issues
- **PDF Security**: Added sanitization to prevent PDF injection attacks in contract generation
- **Input Validation**: Enhanced Zod schemas with better error messages and security checks
- **WebSocket Security**: Added message validation and sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- **Authentication**: Improved error handling and token management with automatic cleanup
- **Secret Management**: Removed all hardcoded credentials from codebase for safe remixing
- **Environment Security**: Implemented secure configuration management via Replit Secrets only

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes
- **Real-Time Race Conditions**: Fixed critical issue where recipients could accept cancelled offers due to stale data
- **Production WebSocket Limitation**: Resolved WebSocket unavailability in Firebase Functions with Firestore listener fallback
- **Status Validation**: Added server-side checks to prevent invalid offer status transitions
- **Unhandled Promise Rejections**: Added comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- **Firebase Auth**: Fixed token refresh logic and corrupted data cleanup
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript consistency and added proper type guards
- **Query Client**: Enhanced error handling for network failures and authentication issues
- **Phone Number Validation**: Fixed production error where undefined phone values caused `.replace()` to fail
- **Null Safety**: Enhanced all phone number formatting functions with proper type guards and null checks

### üìù Code Quality Improvements
- **Sanitization Utils**: Added comprehensive input sanitization functions
- **Error Logging**: Enhanced error tracking with context information
- **Memory Management**: Improved localStorage cleanup and data consistency
- **Rate Limiting**: Strengthened security measures for API endpoints
