## System Architecture
The platform follows a mobile-first, security-first, and cloud-ready architectural approach.
- **UI/UX**: Features a modern, compact card design with clean typography, consistent light blue background (`#e1edfd`), and white headers. Visual indicators like directional arrow badges and color-coded financial perspectives (Green for lent, Orange for owed) are used for instant recognition. The design is responsive, WCAG 2.1 compliant, and includes smooth page transitions, loading states, and skeleton screens.
- **Technical Implementations**:
    - **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
    - **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript.

    - **Authentication**: JWT with banking-grade security and Firebase Authentication.
    - **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for instant notifications.
    - **Payment Workflow**: Implements a robust payment validation system ensuring compliance with repayment schedules and automatic due date advancement upon payment approval.
    - **Code Quality**: Adheres to banking industry compliance standards, includes comprehensive error boundaries, network error handling, and a sophisticated testing infrastructure using Vitest and React Testing Library with 70% coverage thresholds.
- **System Design Choices**:
    - **Security First**: Emphasizes banking-grade authentication, audit trails, and security hardening.
    - **Compliance**: Designed to adhere to RBI guidelines and banking standards.
    - **Cloud Ready**: Built for cloud-native deployment.
    - **Firebase First**: Utilizes Firebase services for authentication, Firestore database, hosting, and functions.
    - **Monitoring**: Integrates comprehensive health checks (`/api/health`, `/api/ready`, `/api/live`, `/api/health/detailed`) for application monitoring.
    - **Database Schema**: Includes core entities like Users, Offers, Payments, Notifications, and Audit for robust functionality and compliance, primarily managed within Firestore.

## External Dependencies
- **Payment Gateways**: UPI integration ready.
