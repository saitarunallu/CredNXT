# Security Guidelines for CredNXT P2P Lending Platform

## üîí Security Overview

This project implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect user data and financial information. When remixing or deploying this application, follow these security guidelines.

## üö® Critical Security Requirements

### 1. No Hardcoded Secrets
- **Never commit API keys, passwords, or sensitive data to version control**
- All secrets must be configured in Replit Secrets or environment variables
- The codebase is designed to be safely shared without exposing credentials

### 2. Required Secrets Configuration

When setting up this project, configure these secrets in **Replit Secrets**:

```
FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY          - Firebase Web API key (client-side)
FIREBASE_CONFIG_JSON          - Complete Firebase service account JSON (server-side)
```

### 3. Firebase Project Setup

**For New Deployments:**
1. Create a new Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable Authentication, Firestore, Storage, and Functions
3. Generate service account credentials
4. Configure Firestore security rules (provided in `firestore.rules`)
5. Set up proper IAM permissions

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Implemented

### Input Security
- **XSS Prevention**: All user inputs are sanitized
- **Input Validation**: Strict Zod schemas with comprehensive validation
- **SQL Injection Protection**: NoSQL database with parameterized queries
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoint protection against abuse

### Authentication Security
- **Firebase Authentication**: Industry-standard authentication service
- **Token Validation**: Server-side token verification
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic cleanup
- **Multi-device Support**: Secure cross-device authentication

### Data Security
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with Firestore security rules
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security monitoring
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation for all operations

### PDF Security
- **Injection Prevention**: Sanitized inputs for PDF generation
- **Access Control**: Secure file storage with permission validation
- **Content Validation**: Strict content filtering for documents

### Network Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All traffic secured with SSL/TLS
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup
- **WebSocket Security**: Message validation and sanitization
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and authentication on all endpoints

## üöÄ Secure Deployment Process

### Environment Configuration
1. **Never use production credentials in development**
2. **Use separate Firebase projects for dev/staging/production**
3. **Configure secrets only in secure environment variables**
4. **Validate all environment configuration before deployment**

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All secrets configured in Replit Secrets (not in files)
- [ ] Firebase security rules deployed and tested
- [ ] API rate limiting configured and tested
- [ ] Input validation tested with malicious inputs
- [ ] Authentication flow tested thoroughly
- [ ] PDF generation tested with edge cases
- [ ] WebSocket connections secured and tested

### Production Security
- [ ] Firebase project configured with production settings
- [ ] IAM permissions set to principle of least privilege
- [ ] Firestore backup configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Content Security Policy implemented

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging and reporting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics
- **Security Alerts**: Automated alerts for suspicious activity
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all operations

### Manual Security Reviews
- **Monthly Security Reviews**: Regular security assessment
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security scans
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual security testing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warnings

### Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid
1. **Exposed API Keys**: Never commit secrets to version control
2. **Weak Authentication**: Always use Firebase Auth, never custom auth
3. **Unsanitized Inputs**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
4. **Insecure File Uploads**: Validate all file uploads and types
5. **Missing Rate Limiting**: Always implement API rate limiting

### Red Flags When Remixing
- Any hardcoded API keys or secrets in code files
- Missing input validation on forms
- Disabled security rules or authentication
- Unsafe file upload handling
- Missing HTTPS enforcement

## üìû Security Incident Response

### If You Discover a Security Issue
1. **Do not create public issues** for security vulnerabilities
2. **Immediately revoke compromised credentials**
3. **Update all affected systems**
4. **Review audit logs for unauthorized access**
5. **Contact project maintainers privately**

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Credential Compromise**: Immediately revoke and regenerate all keys
2. **Data Breach**: Assess scope, contain breach, notify affected users
3. **Service Compromise**: Take affected services offline immediately
4. **Vulnerability Discovery**: Patch immediately, assess impact

## üéØ Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use security linting tools

### For Deployment
- Use infrastructure as code
- Implement automated security testing
- Use secure CI/CD pipelines
- Monitor all production services
- Maintain incident response procedures
